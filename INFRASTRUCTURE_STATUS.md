# Infrastructure Status Report

## ðŸŽ¯ Current State

Your healthcare application is now successfully connected to Azure with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline fully operational.

### âœ… What's Working

1. **Azure Resources** (deployed and operational):

   - **Resource Group**: `healthcare-content-rg` (East US)
   - **Storage Account**: `healthcarestorefv0vlbg2` (Standard LRS)
   - **Container**: `healthcare-files` (Private access)

2. **GitHub Actions Workflows**:

   - **Test Workflow**: Validates Python code on every push
   - **Deploy Workflow**: Plans Terraform and tests deployment on main branch

3. **Authentication**:

   - âœ… Service Principal configured with correct permissions
   - âœ… GitHub secrets properly set up
   - âœ… Azure CLI authentication working

4. **Terraform Configuration**:
   - âœ… Uses data sources to reference existing resources
   - âœ… Avoids resource creation conflicts
   - âœ… Provides consistent outputs for CI/CD

### ðŸ”§ Recent Fixes Applied

1. **Resource Import Issue**:

   - **Problem**: GitHub Actions tried to create existing resources
   - **Solution**: Switched from `resource` blocks to `data` sources
   - **Result**: No more "resource already exists" errors

2. **Connection String Issue**:

   - **Problem**: Environment variable not passed correctly to Python script
   - **Solution**: Fixed export statement in GitHub Actions workflow
   - **Result**: File uploads to Azure Blob Storage now work

3. **Authentication Issue**:
   - **Problem**: Service principal not found error
   - **Solution**: Created new service principal with correct credentials
   - **Result**: Azure authentication working properly

### ðŸ“‹ Architecture Summary

```
GitHub Repository
    â†“ (push to main)
GitHub Actions Workflow
    â†“
1. Terraform Plan/Apply (references existing resources)
2. Python App Testing
3. Azure File Upload Test
    â†“
Azure Blob Storage (healthcare-files container)
```

### ðŸš€ Current Capabilities

Your pipeline now automatically:

1. **Validates** infrastructure changes with Terraform
2. **Tests** Python application code
3. **Authenticates** with Azure using service principal
4. **Uploads** test files to verify deployment
5. **Reports** success/failure status

### ðŸ“Š Verification Results

- âœ… Local file upload test: **SUCCESSFUL**
- âœ… Terraform plan/apply: **SUCCESSFUL**
- âœ… Azure authentication: **SUCCESSFUL**
- âœ… GitHub Actions deployment: **READY**

### ðŸ”„ Next Workflow Run

The latest push should now complete successfully with:

- No resource creation conflicts
- Proper environment variable handling
- Successful file upload verification
